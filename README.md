## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements a **serverless cloud solution** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** that monitors simulated flight prices and automatically notifies users by email when a lower fare is detected.

The application follows an **Event-Driven Architecture**, where Amazon EventBridge triggers AWS Lambda functions responsible for processing flight data, evaluating price changes, storing information in Amazon DynamoDB, and sending notifications through Amazon SNS and Amazon SES.

The solution was designed to demonstrate how AWS managed services can be integrated to build scalable, cost-effective, and fully serverless applications without managing traditional servers.

### Business Scenario

Many travelers miss airline promotions because checking ticket prices manually is time-consuming and inefficient.

This project simulates an automated monitoring service that continuously evaluates flight prices and immediately notifies subscribed users whenever a lower price is available.

# 🏗️ Solution Architecture

The application is built following a **serverless event-driven architecture** using fully managed AWS services.

Instead of relying on traditional servers, the system reacts automatically to scheduled events, processes flight information, stores data, and sends email notifications without requiring infrastructure management.

This architecture provides:

- High scalability
- Low operational cost
- Automatic execution
- Minimal infrastructure management
- Easy maintenance
- High availability

The following AWS services are integrated to build the complete solution:

| AWS Service | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Amazon EventBridge | Triggers scheduled events to start the monitoring process. |
| AWS Lambda | Executes the application logic and processes flight information. |
| Amazon DynamoDB | Stores user subscriptions and flight monitoring data. |
| Amazon SNS | Publishes notification events. |
| Amazon SES | Sends email alerts to subscribed users. |
| AWS IAM | Manages permissions and secure access between AWS services. |

# ☁️ AWS Services Used

The project integrates multiple AWS managed services to build a fully serverless and event-driven solution.

## Amazon EventBridge

**Purpose**

Triggers the monitoring process automatically based on a scheduled rule.

**Why was it selected?**

Amazon EventBridge provides a reliable serverless scheduler that eliminates the need for cron jobs or dedicated servers.

---

## AWS Lambda

**Purpose**

Executes the business logic of the application, processes simulated flight prices, validates price changes, and coordinates communication between AWS services.

**Why was it selected?**

AWS Lambda allows code execution without provisioning or managing servers, automatically scaling according to demand.

---

## Amazon DynamoDB

**Purpose**

Stores user subscriptions and monitored flight information.

**Why was it selected?**

DynamoDB offers low-latency performance, automatic scaling, and seamless integration with serverless applications.

---

## Amazon SNS

**Purpose**

Publishes notification events generated by the application.

**Why was it selected?**

Amazon SNS simplifies message distribution and decouples communication between services.

---

## Amazon SES

**Purpose**

Sends email notifications to subscribed users when a lower flight price is detected.

**Why was it selected?**

Amazon SES is a scalable and cost-effective email service fully integrated with AWS.

---

## AWS IAM

**Purpose**

Controls permissions and secure communication between AWS services.

**Why was it selected?**

IAM follows the principle of least privilege, ensuring secure access to AWS resources.

---

# 🚀 Deployment Process

The application was deployed following a serverless architecture using AWS managed services.

## Deployment Steps

### 1️⃣ Configure IAM

Create IAM roles and policies with the minimum required permissions for AWS Lambda to access Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, Amazon SES, and Amazon EventBridge.

---

### 2️⃣ Create the DynamoDB Table

Create the DynamoDB table to store user subscription information and flight monitoring data.

---

### 3️⃣ Deploy the Lambda Function

Upload the Python source code to AWS Lambda and configure the execution role.

---

### 4️⃣ Configure Amazon EventBridge

Create a scheduled rule that automatically invokes the Lambda function at predefined intervals.

---

### 5️⃣ Configure Amazon SNS

Create an SNS topic to publish notification events generated by the application.

---

### 6️⃣ Configure Amazon SES

Verify sender and recipient email addresses and configure Amazon SES to send notification emails.

---

### 7️⃣ Test the Application

Execute the Lambda function manually to verify the complete workflow.

---

### 8️⃣ Automated Monitoring

After deployment, Amazon EventBridge automatically triggers the monitoring process according to the configured schedule.
